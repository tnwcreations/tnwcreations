### Hi! I'm Erin, founder of Web Development Agency TNW Creations, LLC. 


## I'm a Full Stack Engineer & Media Publisher. I have a long history of working in radio, design, coding web and software and writing. I am most versed with HTML, JavaScript and JSON and Iâ€™ve been building and deploying websites since I was a teenager in 1995. ðŸ¤¯ Over the years, my static coding has shifted to database builds. Now my interest in stronger cyber security has spurred me to return to my original static no-database builds while deploying new methods. Despite my 26 years as a Coder, I may be learning more than I teach while navigating GitHub for awhile...
